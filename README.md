# [Sensor Integration Framework](https://github.com/aspectsecurity/sensor-integration-framework)

Sensor Integration Framework is a framework that can be used to integrate software test tools in a continuous integration (CI) environment.  Most of the CI solutions you can get will integrate easily with popular unit testing frameworks.  They will probably not integrate easily with commercial static analysis tools, for example.  This project is meant to make that integration job much easier.  SIF is being developed by the [core team](https://github.com/aspectsecurity/sensor-integration-framework/people) with the support and involvement of the community.

We aim to release SIF 1.0 by March 2015.
