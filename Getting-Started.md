### Eclipse
*Prerequisite: The Maven plugin is required*
If you're using Eclipse, the setup process is simple.

<ol>
<li>From the 'File' menu, select 'Import...'</li>
<li>In the 'Maven' folder, select 'Existing Maven Projects'</li>
<li>Set the 'Root Directory' as the root directory of your project (this is the directory that contains the LICENSE file). Eclipse should find 6 pom files</li>
<li>Click the 'Finish' button</li>
</ol>
You should see 6 new projects in your Eclipse workspace, which should all compile with no errors.
